# Setups

These are specific setups using the protocols/benchmarking classes - used mainly for debug purposes.
Each setup might require its specific args/resources. For example, some might run local only, other might receive
IPs to runs in several hosts. Check setup description for details.

## Setup 1 - In progress

VCBC execution. There are 4 replicas - one broadcaster and 3 listeners. I send broadcasts at a specified rate.
